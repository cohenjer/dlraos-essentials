# DLRAOS: Dictionary-based Low-Rank Approximation One Sparse repository

This repository contains the codes for reproducing the dlra package. This is a dedicated one-sparse version.

It can be easily installed by running from this repository
pip install . -r requirements.txt

A particular requirement is mscode package available [here(todo)](todo).

The web documentation for the package is available under doc/build/html/index.html

This package refreshes the proposed algorithms for one-sparse DLRA from [this papertodo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12399). It contains in dlra/algorithms.py all the dictionary-based low-rank approximation heuristics developed in this reference.

The old codes are in matlab and can be found [heretodo](todo). The general k-sparse package can be found [heretodo](todo).

Please cite the above mentioned publication if you use this package.
