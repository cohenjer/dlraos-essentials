# DLRAOS: Dictionary-based Low-Rank Approximation One Sparse repository

This repository contains the codes for reproducing the dlra package. This is a dedicated one-sparse version.

It can be easily installed by running from this repository
pip install -e .

This package refreshes the proposed algorithms for one-sparse DLRA from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00541). It contains in dlraos/algorithms.py all the dictionary-based low-rank approximation heuristics developed in this reference.

The old codes are in matlab and can be found [here](https://github.com/cohenjer/Tensor_codes/tree/master/Dictionary-based_decomposition/DCPD/DCPD_codes). The general k-sparse package can be found [here](https://github.com/cohenjer/dlra).

Please cite the above mentioned publication if you use this package.
